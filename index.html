    <p id="pText3">When you're talking to me, rememeber to take what I say without a grain of salt.  Because I move so quickly, sometimes I don't think things through all the way before I say them.  Always communicate openly and don't be afraid to ask questions.  If you are having trouble of any sort, communicate that openly and I'll work with you as best as I can.  Always treat me with respect and I'll treat you with respect.  Don't be afraid to challenge my ideas.</p>

        <p id="pText4">Three people is a lot for me, so instead I'll focus on one person I do look up to, Henry Rollins: <br> <br>

            Born in Washington, DC, Rollins is the definition of a self-made man.  He has had an ecclectic career as a preformer, writer, journalist, publisher, actor, actor, activist, comedian, and motivational speaker, but he's most well known as the lead singer of the hardcore punk band, Black Flag.

    <div id="flex" class="border">
        <img src="rollins2.jpg" alt="rollins2" id="rollins2">
        <p id="pText5"> Rollins overcame great adversity in his early life.  At the age of 3, his parents divorced, and he was sexually assaulted as a child and teenager.  He suffered from depression and low self esteem.  Rollins was diagnosed with hyperactiveity and put on Ritalin.  He has not seen his father since he was 18.  
            <br>
            <br>
        Despite facing great adversity, Rollins continues to be one of the most ineresting and progressively-minded celebrities alive today.  He is tirelessly productive, producing an
        enormous amount of music and media.  He is an inspirational and powerful figure, but behind it all he is a highly compassionate and warm-hearted person.  He knows what it's like to
        sit in the seat of weakness, and he never desires to put someone else in that seat.  I think we can all aspire to be a little more like Henry in one way or another.    </p>
